As I'm writing this post, this is the first day of this new year. I'll also be completing my bachelor's degree in a few months. All this makes me think about all the series of events that led me to this day. I was also about to write my very first blog post on my website so I figured, why not let this be it!

I thought this would be a nice way to document my journey. So here it goes...

> This is my very first blog post. Be prepared for a boatload of cringeness & some rather unusual grammatical structures ahead. ðŸ˜…

My journey into web development began all the way back in 2019, I had just given my 10th board exams & was awaiting results during the vacations. This is when I got my first real world project (I still had no idea about anything other than HTML & CSS).

Rewinding into the past even more, I always had a curiosity regarding the inner workings of things we see daily. And had a habit of opening up toys & gadgets and used to get into trouble for the same quite a bit.

Later to avoid causing mishaps & by fascination from some of PIXAR's creations I steered into the world of 3D Modeling with [Blender](https://blender.org/). I messed with sculpting, texturing & just modeling things of interest for the sheer fun of it.

Next stage led me to exploring game development with [Godot](https://godot.org/) engine & had quite a lot of fun doing it. Although this phase lasted shorter than the others.

Next I watched some Web Development videos & had a comfortable grasp of HTML & CSS. Created some rather ugly looking pages & then paused everything for a few weeks in order to prepare for board exams.

I'm quite grateful to those random explorations. They helped me make better, more informed choices.

Now coming back to that project, It was given to me by a good friend of my dad, as it was just at the concept stage. The requirement was to make a user form which when submitted would save the data to a database & output a generated ID card image. And there I was, without the idea of what a database even was.

He was from a non development background but had given me a hint that he had heard "PHP" was being used to make such things. I got to work, learning along the way. After a lot of confusion and suffering the app was ready & I somehow figured out the workflow for deployment too. In the end, that app never went to production but it did serve as a valuable learning experience & I viewed web development as a career choice for me.

Later I got the project to make a new site for a local school. With the design already provided. I ended up making it with HTML & CSS. As this was my first medium sized project the code got quite messy... But by some miracle the client themselves wanted to redo the whole design of the website & asked if I was okay with it. Smiling internally, I said that was fine & was quite happy that I got to redo it again, this time with a proper structure.

This project then went on a hold due to redesign & till then I got a project to develop a site in WordPress for a local dentist. This was my very first WordPress experience. Later my dad's friend introduced me to one of his friends who was a developer, I got advice that I should explore making apps with NodeJS.

The school project continued again & then I ended up hooking the site with NodeJS backend & Strapi CMS. Later helping the school setup & maintain GSuite for Education (Now known as Google Workspace). Further into time, I got some more projects for developing some static sites, further helping to solidify understanding of CSS & layouts.

Fast forward to more recent times, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, fiddling around with Linux based systems, learning different frameworks & other platform specific application development approaches. With a sprinkle of certifications.

I got to work as an intern at [XDE Studios](https://xdestudios.com/), learning a lot about project management & dealing with clients. While having some of the most memorable experiences of my life with some amazing & talented people.

I'm about to join my 2nd organisation, [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com/) with more experiences ahead & interesting thing is I'll be primarily working with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) (sort of feels like a full circle here).

It wasn't possible to include all of my experiences into a blog post (as this is already getting quite long), but I'm thankful to all the wonderful people I met & all the failures and successes till date. As this new year nears, hoping that it brings some of the best times to all the people.

If you've made it till here, Thank you so much for spending your time & I will be grateful if you could share your feedback through any social channels or email.

Happy New Year ðŸŽŠ
